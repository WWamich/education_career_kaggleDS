# Research on educational careers and salaries

This salary study provides data (gender, salary after graduation, specialty, average grade in school). 
The mathematical distribution that is inherent in the desired sample was considered in detail (I considered salaries specifically). The parameters were evaluated. The method of Bayesian parameter estimation based on a different mathematical distribution was also demonstrated. The data was taken from Kaggle.
